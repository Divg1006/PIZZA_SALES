# Pizza Sales Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes pizza sales data to uncover key business insights and drive data-driven decision-making. Using Microsoft SQL Server, I imported, cleaned, and structured the raw sales data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Advanced SQL queries were developed to calculate important KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, and best-selling products.

I further analyzed sales trends by category, time (day/hour), and customer preferences. To visualize these insights, I created interactive Excel dashboards using PivotTables and slicers that highlight sales performance, peak times, and product popularity. The dashboards allow easy exploration of sales patterns and support strategic planning for improving sales.

## Tools & Technologies  
- Microsoft SQL Server (data import, cleaning, querying)  
- Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, dashboards, visualization)  
- GitHub (project documentation and version control)

## Key Features  
- Data cleaning and validation using SQL queries  
- Calculation of KPIs (total orders, total revenue, average order value)  
- Analysis of sales by pizza type, size, and time periods  
- Interactive Excel dashboard for sales insights and trend visualization  
- Well-documented SQL scripts and Excel workbooks  

## How to Use  
1. Explore the `/SQL` folder for the database schema and query scripts.  
2. Open the Excel workbook in `/Excel` to interact with the dashboards.  
3. Review the documentation here for detailed explanations and key findings.

## Business Impact
